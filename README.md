# object_detection

## The object detection project is about detecting the objects such as car and traffic signals from the images

# Overview 

- The dataset contains the images of cars on the road
- It detects the cars and all other objects from the image
- I have used the yolov5 model in order to detect the model
- I have trained more than 500 images through yolov5 model

# Data Source
- I have used the car detection dataset from kaggle. you can get [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R1LzmhUGLrUk3ySnh1446UXTlRM0rCbZ)
